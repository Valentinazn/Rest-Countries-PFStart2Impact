# Front end Mentor - Rest-Countries-API  X Start2Impact Front End Developer final project

As my final project that will allow me to obtain my master's degree as a front end developer, I chose this Front End Mentor challenge.

## Welcome! 👋


[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge 🦾 

is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Bonus: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
